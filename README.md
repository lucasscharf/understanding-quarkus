# Study codes

Study codes from books [Understanding Quarkus](https://developers.redhat.com/books/understanding-quarkus) and [Practising Quarkus](https://developers.redhat.com/books/practising-quarkus), both from [Antonio Goncalves](https://github.com/agoncal).
Besides it is in public repository, it is focused more in my studies and understanding.
